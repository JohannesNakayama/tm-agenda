# Template Agenda for Toastmasters Meetings

This is a "low-tech" agenda template for Toastmasters meetings (HTML + very little CSS). It is pretty self-explanatory: Just edit the HTML file and put in the names, speech titles, ressources, etc. that you'd like to share. So far, you have to edit the times manually. As of now, I'm not sure if I will write a more sophisticated templating framework because doing everything manually is not unreasonably arduous. If you feel compelled to write a simple static site generator that automates (some of) this process, feel free to make a pull request (I'll only merge it if I like it, though).


There are many deployment options that are free of charge (Github Pages, Netlify...). So far, I have opted for Netlify. The file sizes of this agenda are reasonably small, so sharing your page for a meeting won't put too much strain on your free bandwidth limits...
